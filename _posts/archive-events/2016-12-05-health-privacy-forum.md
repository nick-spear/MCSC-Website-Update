<p>Edhward Sihler, MCSC's Scientific Systems Administrator, will be speaking at the Healthcare Privacy & Security Forum, produced by HIMSS Media (a global, cause-based, not-for-profit organization focused on better health through information technology). The Forum will offer three days of keynotes, case studies, panel discussions, and networking opportunities for participants to discover how organizations are preventing, detecting, responding to or recovering from todayâ€™s security threats.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Sihler's talk was a discussion of using virtualization desktops to combat malware, improve backups, simplify support, and control external devices all with an eye to improving security at the desktop with little additional expense.
