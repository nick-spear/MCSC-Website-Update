<p>From Project>Login: "The fifth-round of Project>Login receptions will kick off the 2017 paid-internship recruiting season in September and provide opportunities for students to talk with IT professionals and recruiters from some of the Maine companies that want to hire them. Business representatives talk with students about the role of IT in their companies, the opportunities for internships and continuing employment, and what theyâ€™re looking for in successful professionals."</p>
