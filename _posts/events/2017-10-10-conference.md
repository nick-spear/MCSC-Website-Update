The University of Southern Maine is hosting the Partnership in Cyber
Security Summit with Honorary Hosts Senator Collins and Senator King on 10
October 2017 at the University of Southern Maine Abramson Center.  Summit
Sponsors include: Maine Emergency Management Agency, Maine Cyber Security
Cluster, and Coast Guard Sector Northern New England.
</p>

<p>
The Partnership in Cyber Security Summit's goal is to discuss future cyber
security threats, vulnerabilities and consequences facing the region and
address solutions that will mitigate the impact of future threats. The
target audience is organizations of all sizes in the Northern New England
region with the knowledge of or interest in Cyber Security.
</p>

<p>
As cyber technology penetrates every aspect of our lives the number of reachable and
exploitable vulnerabilities continues to grow. There isnâ€™t an industry or institution that is
isolated from the risks posed by the expanding attack surfaces. The Partnership in Cyber
Security Summit morning session will endeavor to unmask future threats and
vulnerabilities and address the challenges of rethinking our approaches to managing
threats and vulnerabilities. The afternoon session will identify solutions and resources
that will help to build the regional wall that will provide the tools to prevent, mitigate,
and recover from a cyber attack.

<p>
The Maine Syber Security Cluster will appear at the Cyber Security Summit, with the METI and Digital Barbarians projects on
display for those wishing to know more. We hope to see you there!
