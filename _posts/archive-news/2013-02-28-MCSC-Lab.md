USM is building Maine's First Cyber Security Laboratory.<br />
As a shared and secure testing and evaluation environment, it will allow private and public entities to refine 
their technology infrastructures and code on the fly, help them to clearly identify theircompetitive 
advantage by testing their products against some of the most advanced cyber security products in the world, including testing and evaluating 
products from major global vendors before installing these products in their infrastructure, and help entrepreneurs define the true 
commercialization potential of their innovations prior to approaching investors.
