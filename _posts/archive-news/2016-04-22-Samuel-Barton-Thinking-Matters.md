<p>On April 22nd, 2016, MCSC Student Samuel Barton presented at USM's annual student research symposium, Thinking Matters.</p>

<p>Title:<br>
Virtualization Management and the Open Source World</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>
Virtual machines are an incredibly powerful technology, but when a system of virtual machines becomes large, or complex virtual networking is required, one must turn to a virtual machine hypervisor manager to handle them. In the past the only options were paid products like Xen or VMWareâ€™s Sphere; however, the open source community has now produced oVirt, a free, and feature-rich hypervisor manager. Interestingly, this software exposes an issue in the open source world. Open source does not mean cross-platform, even across distributions of Linux.
