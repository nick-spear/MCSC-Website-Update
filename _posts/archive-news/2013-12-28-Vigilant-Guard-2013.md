MCSC in partnership with the Maine Air National Guard were able to 
provide simulated and real cyber events to private industry&#44; local&#44; 
state and federal agencies as part of the Vigilant Guard 14 disaster 
exercise by leveraging students and computer facilities from within 
the University of Maine System&#46;  In all previous drills of this nature 
the cyber event was confined to a &#34;range&#34; with results reported to other 
participants and these rarely&#44; if ever&#44; involved teams from multiple 
organizations&#46;

The event was a success because&#58;

<ul class="resource_list">	
	
	<li>
		We were able to integrate cyber events with other activities and thus provide a more realistic experience for the participants in 
		VG14 and enabling them to complete some of their annual training goals thus saving 
		money&#44; time while improving the participants ability to respond to various forms of disasters&#46;		
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>
		Students gained work experience both within the cyber security and related fields along with the planning and execution of complex 
		exercises&#46;
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>
		The Maine Cyber Security Cluster&#44; housed on the USM campus&#44; proved that it was able to act as a nexus of contact between the 
		University of Maine System&#44; private industry,&#44; local&#44; state and federal agencies in the field of cyber security&#46;
	</li>
</ul>
<br />
Two near term tangible outgrowths of the VG14 work will be a pair of classes targeting cyber security education and outreach within Maine. 
								
The firstof these classes will be a 4 hour event aimed at individuals and small organizations that wish to experience a cyber event and 
respond within a controlled environment&#46; 
<br />
<br />
								
The second of these classes will be a longer term &#34;mini VG14&#34; that will enable an organization to&#58;

<ul class="resource_list">
	<li>Integrate a cyber event into a larger disaster drill</li>
	<br />								
	<li>Complete some of their annual cyber training</li>
	<br />				
	<li>Test mutual aid for cyber events</li>
</ul>
<br />
The &#34;mini VG14&#34; will also expose students from the University of Maine
System to working with government and industry partners&#46;
