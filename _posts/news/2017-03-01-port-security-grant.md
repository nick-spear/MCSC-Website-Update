<p>MCSC has been awarded a grant to enhance the cyber security stance of ports in Maine and then onto ports within New England.  This project will run for three years and expand on current MCSC student work in the areas of portable cyber ranges and vulnerability assessments. The PGSP will target two primary areas: Maritime Domain Awareness and Resiliency and Recovery. Domain awareness
will be addressed by helping specific organizations and groups within the port understand cyber risks, spot a cyber event quickly, and share information about both risks and threats. Resiliency and recovery will be addressed with practice, we will provide facilities for organizations
within the port area the opportunity to recognize a live cyber attack and exercise their response/mitigation and recovery plan.</p>
