<h1>What We Do</h1>

<p>Students, working individually and in small teams, are engaged in a variety of ongoing research projects at MCSC. These projects involve experimenting with cyber security techniques and tools, making technological contributions to the Cluster's lab facility, and providing security related assistance to organizations in the regional community.</p>

<p>In addition, students participate in The Beta Port Project, an educational cyber security exercise that allows students to gain practical experience in preventing and mitigating cyber attacks in real time. Students also help to build the infrastructure used during Beta Port simulations.</p>
