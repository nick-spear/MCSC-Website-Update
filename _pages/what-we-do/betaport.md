<h1>Beta Port</h1>

<p>Beta Port, loosely modeled on the city of Portland, is a cyber security exercise environment. With the guidance of MCSC’s Scientific Systems Administrator, Edward Sihler, students architected the Beta Port infrastructure. This involved devising a group of fictional businesses to inhabit Beta Port and grow them into a collection of virtual machines and virtual networks. Students implemented a variety of technologies to actualize Beta Port and continue to maintain it acting as the virtual city’s Systems Administrators, Network Administrators, Web Developers, Database Administrators, and more.</p>
