<h1>Student Projects</h1>

<h2>Beta Port</h2>

<p>
Beta Port, loosely modeled on the city of Portland, is a cyber security exercise environment. With the guidance of MCSC’s Scientific Systems Administrator, Edward Sihler, students architected the Beta Port infrastructure. This involved devising a group of fictional businesses to inhabit Beta Port and grow them into a collection of virtual machines and virtual networks. Students implemented a variety of technologies to actualize Beta Port and continue to maintain it acting as the virtual city’s Systems Administrators, Network Administrators, Web Developers, Database Administrators, and more.

<h2>Range in a Box</h2>

<p>
Students have developed a prototype portable cyber range (fits in a few boxes none weighing more than 60lbs) that simulates a small to medium sized organization with email, web, and file servers, along with security cameras, badge systems, and some specialized equipment found in ports.   The primary use is for an organization to test their cyber response not just within the IT department but also the wider organization.  The initial usage has been successful and now improvements to the badge and cam systems must be implemented. This is a long term project that will
involve many updates to create modules so that it will work for the widest possible range of organizations and will allow repreated usage without replaying the same event.  Credit should also be given to the entire lab as all members pulled together to make this a success.

<h2>Cyber Blib</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Tyler LaBerge, Caroline Whitman</p>

<p>This project goal is to create a near real time visualization of active cyber attacks within Maine.  Currently it is used within a closed environment only as we are testing the evaluation and display of attracts the next stage will be to integrate results from system logs
followed by creation of honey pots.</p>

<h2>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Tyler LaBerge, Vincent Orlando</p>

<p>This project is about detecting and mapping vulnerable networks with low or no encryption. This includes "war driving" around town with a wifi antenna listening for networks, and writing the details of any networks it finds to an xml file. This file is then parsed so that the networks can be displayed on Google Maps. A particular focus of this project is ships and their AIS messages, data that all ships send out that includes details about its longitude and latitude, name, dimensions, etc. These messages can be picked up using a radio antenna and this data can be used to determine whether any of the detected vulnerable networks belong to particular ships. A program needed to be written to decode these messages and a way has also been devised to map vulnerable networks to nearby businesses using the Google Places API.</p>
<p>The assessment and mapping tool has now moved out of the lab and is
being used to search for signals and map the results. Efforts are now
underway to reduce the size and improve the usability.</p>

<h2>Truman Show</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Caroline Whitman</p>

<p>The Truman Show deals with web traffic monitoring. It simulates people surfing the web using a web crawler to go through websites, click links, create accounts, and make mistakes along the way. At the end, it can be seen where each of these "people" went and how fast they went there.</p>

<h1>Past Student Projects</h1>

<h2>The Sensor Project </h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Samuel Barton</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a secure, modular, and easy to install network of sensors that will gather data from network traffic to temperature. The project will also create a suite of software for reporting, analysis, and presentation of data collected. Such a sensor system does not currently exist, and current systems, which solve part of the problem, are expensive and insecure, as well as proprietary and, therefore, difficult to extend to new areas of study. Development of this system has required research into operating systems, and software creation in C, Perl, and Python. The significance of this project lies in its relative simplicity and extensibility new areas of study. </p>

<h2>Statistics Servers</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Alex Weeman</p>

<p>Using discarded servers–ones that would otherwise be scrapped–and refurbishing them, this project aims to restore them for use with statistics software. This work involves implementation of an Ubuntu operating system and installation of R statistical software.</p>

<h2>Data Exfiltration</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Adam Wirth</p>

<p>This project aims to encode data and exfiltrate it through the Linux ping command. The goal is to make detection increasingly subtle.</p>
