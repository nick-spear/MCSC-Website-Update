<h2>Simutrans</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Storme Charette, Katrina Sabochick</p>

<p>Simutrans is an open-source transportation game similar to SimCity. It’s being used to create a real-time replica of Beta Port, the fictional city used in The Beta Port Project simulations. The Simutrans project involves taking the existing game and modifying it to run scenarios like weather disasters and power failures, and creating a data filter to send information to the SCADA systems. The main goal is to be able to control Simutrans from both within the game and through external requests from SCADA to monitor and fix problems that may occur, such as delivering diesel fuel through the trucking system, or sending passengers and goods through railway. The end result will allow clients to observe realistic scenarios and explore different ways to fix issues efficiently.</p>

<h2>Beta Port</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Samuel Barton, Christina Costello, Zachary Landry, Alex Weeman</p>

<p>Beta Port, loosely modeled on the city of Portland, is a cyber security exercise environment. With the guidance of MCSC’s Scientific Systems Administrator, Edward Sihler, students architected the Beta Port infrastructure. This involved devising a group of fictional businesses to inhabit Beta Port and grow them into a collection of virtual machines and virtual networks. Students implemented a variety of technologies to actualize Beta Port and continue to maintain it acting as the virtual city’s Systems Administrators, Network Administrators, Web Developers, Database Administrators, and more. </p>

<h2>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Tyler LaBerge</p>

<p>This project is about detecting and mapping vulnerable networks with low or no encryption. This includes "war driving" around town with a wifi antenna listening for networks, and writing the details of any networks it finds to an xml file. This file is then parsed so that the networks can be displayed on Google Maps. A particular focus of this project is ships and their AIS messages, data that all ships send out that includes details about its longitude and latitude, name, dimensions, etc. These messages can be picked up using a radio antenna and this data can be used to determine whether any of the detected vulnerable networks belong to particular ships. A program needed to be written to decode these messages and a way has also been devised to map vulnerable networks to nearby businesses using the Google Places API.</p>

<h2>Data Exfiltration</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Adam Wirth</p>

<p>This project aims to encode data and exfiltrate it through the Linux ping command. The goal is to make detection increasingly subtle.</p>

<h2>The Sensor Project </h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Samuel Barton</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a secure, modular, and easy to install network of sensors that will gather data from network traffic to temperature. The project will also create a suite of software for reporting, analysis, and presentation of data collected. Such a sensor system does not currently exist, and current systems, which solve part of the problem, are expensive and insecure, as well as proprietary and, therefore, difficult to extend to new areas of study. Development of this system has required research into operating systems, and software creation in C, Perl, and Python. The significance of this project lies in its relative simplicity and extensibility new areas of study. </p>

<h2>Statistics Servers</h2> 

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Alex Weeman</p>

<p>Using discarded servers–ones that would otherwise be scrapped–and refurbishing them, this project aims to restore them for use with statistics software. This work involves implementation of an Ubuntu operating system and installation of R statistical software.</p>

<h2>Truman Show</h2>

<p><strong>Students:</strong> Caroline Whitman</p>

<p>The Truman Show deals with web traffic monitoring. It simulates people surfing the web using a web crawler to go through websites, click links, create accounts, and make mistakes along the way. At the end, it can be seen where each of these "people" went and how fast they went there.</p>
