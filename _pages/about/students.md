<p><strong>Major:</strong> Computer Science</p>
<p><strong>Semesters at MCSC:</strong> 1</p>
<p><strong>Projects at MCSC:</strong> Simutrans</p>
<p><strong>Work you've done at MCSC that you're really proud of:</strong> The work I've been doing to create a development platform for MCSC developers to extend Simutrans.</p>
<p><strong>The best part of working at MCSC:</strong> I love that I am allowed to solve problems at my own pace and in my own way. There's less pressure to 'meet the deadline' than there is to learn and improve my skills.</p>
<p><strong>Ways in which working at MCSC is going to make your career path easier to navigate:</strong> My work at MCSC continues to expose me to elementary problems and development challenges in a safe environment. This will equip me with confidence in tackling bigger and better problems when I start my career. </p>


<h2>Christina Costello</h2>

<p><strong>Years at USM:</strong> 1</p>
<p><strong>Major:</strong> Computer Science</p>
<p><strong>Semesters at MCSC:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Projects at MCSC:</strong> Beta Port, MCSC’s Website</p>
<p><strong>Work you've done at MCSC that you're really proud of:</strong> Building a website with Django, writing a Python web spider, and building a website with AngularJS.</p>
<p><strong>The best part of working at MCSC:</strong> The flexibility I’m afforded to work on what interests me.</p>

<h2>Tyler LaBerge</h2>

<p><strong>Years at USM:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Major:</strong> Computer Science</p>
<p><strong>Semesters at MCSC:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Projects at MCSC:</strong> Truman Show Web Traffic Simulator, Beta Port SCADA, AIS/Kismet Decoder and Plotter.
Work you've done at MCSC that you're really proud of: I'm very proud of the AIS decoder program I created. AIS message's are coded signals that all ships and vessels send out. They contain information such as a vessel's name, longitude and latitude, etc. The AIS messages can be picked up with a radio antenna and then fed through my program to decode them into a human readable form and plotted onto google earth. I had to do thorough research into the protocol of AIS messages and how each part of the message is encoded in order to write this program. The end result was extremely satisfying. Being able to pick up AIS messages from ships here in Portland and then plot them on google earth with detailed information about each ship is something I think is very cool, and am very proud of.</p>
<p><strong>The best part of working at MCSC:</strong> I think the best part of working at MCSC is being able to learn so many new things by working on real world projects. Every project I have worked on here has taught me something new and has given me invaluable experience.</p>
<p><strong>Ways in which working at MCSC is going to make your career path easier to navigate:</strong> I think having experience working on real world projects here will be the biggest help as I continue down my career path. Working on projects in the classroom is valuable however there is nothing like actually working on a big, complex project for the real world. Being prepared with this experience for the future will be incredibly valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Work you've done at MCSC that you're really proud of:</strong> Over the past few months, I've been proud to work with the open-source transportation simulator to be used to run scenarios of different situations on a model of the city of Portland.</p>
<p><strong>The best part of working at MCSC:</strong> The most rewarding part of working at MCSC is the opportunity to explore different areas of study that I might not have discovered in a classroom setting, and solving real-world problems by collaborating with other programmers.</p>
<p><strong>Ways in which working at MCSC is going to make your career path easier to navigate:</strong> This ability to work in a team environment with personal exploration will be a great advantage to my career, as I will be able to have experience with research projects and documentations.</p>
