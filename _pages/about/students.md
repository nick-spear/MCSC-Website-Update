John Couch
</h2>
<p>
Information Technology
</p>
<p class="student-about">
John has been a part of MCSC since Spring of 2016 and has directed most of his energy towards building, maintaining, and documenting the Betaport project, a virtual town, which MCSC uses for Cyber Corps - a cyber security training exercise. Through this project, he’s been able to apply the knowledge he’s gained in the classroom by working in a hands on environment. He’s also learned a lot about things that aren’t explicitly taught, like documentation, communication, and leadership skills.

Robert Pariseau
</h2>
<p>
Information Technology, Minor in Computer Science
</p>
<p class="student-about">
Robert joined MCSC just over a year ago where he joined the Betaport team. While on the Betaport team, he helped to build Betaport into the virtual city it is today. He was one of many responsible for setting up fictional company networks within Betaport while developing applications and deploying technologies that would be found in the real world. One of his noted projects while on the Betaport team was the design of Port Hosting Authority Cloud Service (PHACS), a cloud service to be implemented within Betaport.
Robert is now currently heading up the Mobile Range and Digital Barbarians, leading a team of developers in building tools used for cyber security. His team is currently working on Kraken, a password tool that operates over the network, and a Phishing game designed to bring awareness.

Katrina Sabochick
</h2>
<p>
Pure Mathematics, Minor in Computer Science
</p>
<p class="student-about">
Katrina is currently the team leader for the Metropolitan Event Training Interface (METI) project, which simulates crises and disasters in a city to help train clients in emergency response. Within METI, she is working to help design the city interface, as well as forming the foundation for the simulation engine that will be used to run scenarios for clients. Since joining this project, Katrina has worked with multiple programming languages including C, C++, JavaScript, and styling with HTML/CSS to help develop the METI system.

Nickolas Spear
</h2>
<p>
Pure Mathematics, Minor in Computer Science
</p>
<p class="student-about">
Working on both METI and Digital Barbarians projects, Nick loves the excellent oppurtinities to learn beyond course curricula at the MCSC.
C++, R, Python, and Javascript, and core fundamentals of computer networks play
strong roles in both projects that Nick works on. Having minor initial knowledge in these languages and concepts, Nick has enjoyed learning and understanding
these, both on his own and from his project members, as he worked to help bring these projects to fruition.

Tyler LaBerge
</h2>
<p>
Computer Science
</p>
<p class="student-about">
<strong>Projects at MCSC:</strong> Truman Show Web Traffic Simulator, Beta Port SCADA, AIS/Kismet Decoder and Plotter. <br>
<strong>What has been your most proud work at MCSC?</strong> "I'm very proud of the AIS decoder program I created. AIS message's are coded signals that all ships and vessels send out. They contain information such as a vessel's name, longitude and latitude, etc. The AIS messages can be picked up with a radio antenna and then fed through my program to decode them into a human readable form and plotted onto google earth. I had to do thorough research into the protocol of AIS messages and how each part of the message is encoded in order to write this program. The end result was extremely satisfying. Being able to pick up AIS messages from ships here in Portland and then plot them on google earth with detailed information about each ship is something I think is very cool, and am very proud of." <br>
<strong>What has been the best part about MCSC?</strong> "I think the best part of working at MCSC is being able to learn so many new things by working on real world projects. Every project I have worked on here has taught me something new and has given me invaluable experience." <br>
<strong>How has MCSC made your career path easier to navigate?</strong> "I think having experience working on real world projects here will be the biggest help as I continue down my career path. Working on projects in the classroom is valuable however there is nothing like actually working on a big, complex project for the real world. Being prepared with this experience for the future will be incredibly valuable."
