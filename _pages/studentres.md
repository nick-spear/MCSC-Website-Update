<h1>Student Research</h1>

<h3>The Sensor Project</h3>
The goal of this project is to create a secure, modular, and easy to install network of sensors that will gather data from network traffic to temperature. The project will also create a suite of software for reporting, analysis, and presentation of data collected. Such a sensor system does not currently exist, and current systems, which solve part of the problem, are expensive and insecure, as well as proprietary and, therefore, difficult to extend to new areas of study. Development of this system has required research into operating systems, and software creation in C, Perl, and Python. The significance of this project lies in its relative simplicity and extensibility new areas of study.

<h3>The Naked Server and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE)</h3>
The Naked Server project investigates how to reduce the costs associated with running servers, especially how to reduce server energy use, while also increasing server longevity and improving server reliability. Experience a Cyber Event initiative entails the creation of a hands-on educational module that simulates real cybersecurity events and attacks. The tool is aimed toward the general public, and designed to increased participants' awareness of basic cybersecurity best practices. The goal is to promote secure online behavior by learning to identify and understand four commonly occurring cyber attacks.

<h3>Ransomware: Social Engineering by Design</h3>
The Ransomware: Social Engineering by Design project seeks to identify, analyze, and evaluate the ways in which language is deployed in rogue antivirus software--a type of ransomware. The methodology involves word frequency tabulations and rhetorical analyses to determine whether common narratives occur through the use of specific words and phrases typically used in the software. One of the outcomes of this research is to establish a solid empirical basis for the creation of educational materials to increase users' awareness of the strategies used in ransomware, and thereby increase users' security online.

<h3>The PC Rescue Disk</h3>
The Maine Middle School and Maine High School Cybersecurity Project, and The PC Rescue Disk. The Maine Middle School and Maine High School Cybersecurity Project seeks to identify best practices for information technology hardware and software security configurations for teaching and learning in grades 6-12. The PC Rescue Disk work focuses on creating a resource to address and remediate security breaches. In addition, Melissa is Treasurer of the Student Cybersecurity Organization, and has presented her work at the first annual Cybersecurity Summit in Augusta, Maine in June, 2013, and at the Thinking Matters Student Research Symposium at USM in April, 2014.

<h3>Statistics Servers and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE)</h3>
The Statistics Servers project takes discarded servers--ones that would otherwise be scrapped--and refurbishes them to useful functionality. This work involves implementation of an Ubuntu operating system and installation of R statistical software. The restored servers provide processing power that can be used for solving statistical problems. Experience a Cyber Event initiative entails the creation of a hands-on educational module that simulates real cybersecurity events and attacks. The tool is aimed toward the general public, and designed to increased participants' awareness of basic cybersecurity best practices. The goal is to promote secure online behavior by learning to identify and understand four commonly occurring cyber attacks.

<h3>Python Tools</h3>
The goal of Python Tools is to create pentesting tools using Python 2.7 & 3.4 to learn how hackers are able to carry out malicious attacks. Some of these programs included a vulnerability scanner, password crackers for UNIX systems and zip files (using brute force) and a port scanner. These tools were used to replicate the Morris Worm and Conficker, as well as a Zero Day attack. Pulling all these attacks together, created a mass compromise using SSH, FTP and the web to create a botnet among several computers and show how DDoS attacks are so easily performed. The second part of the Python project was creating an automated API using Python modules to securely download specific emails from an imap email account, verifying authentication, parse only the embedded XML data that was needed, and use that data to create a database query and parse the results of that query to another XML file that could be automatically and securely emailed to the appropriate authority. Other research and projects included: SQL Injections, Maine's Vigilant Guard, historical cyber security trends, website development, Cyber Security Educational Resources, PCI DSS 3.0 Compliance, Co-Editor of the Small Business Cyber Security Guide & Trifold, and Co-Founder and President of the Cyber Security Organization (Student Club).
